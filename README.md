#  CSC 466 Project - Life Expectancy

*By SzuChia (Ash) Chen, Cameron Mcgiffert, Wing Fung Wu*

Welcome to our repo where you will find the codes that we used for our research into the influences of meat consumption and GDP per capita on life expectancy. 

The algorithms that we used are

- K-means Clustering
- Linear Regression
- Linear Regression + K-nearest Neighbors stacked model

The stacked model also predicts the likelihood of developing cancers based on our causal factors (meat consumption, GDP, etc.).
